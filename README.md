# Krebs cycle

This repo is my attempt at understanding the biochemical processes involved in
the Kreb's cycle (forward and reverse), covering both metabolism and carbon fixation.

## Wikipedia links:
* [Biological carbon fixation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_carbon_fixation)
* [Bond-dissociation energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond-dissociation_energy)

## Note to self

I'm using [chemfig](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Chemistry_formulae) to write
the chemical formulae.
